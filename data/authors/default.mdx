 I enjoy making things secure that live on the internet. My interest in cybersecurity started back in 2012 when I decided to try hacking things as being script kiddie — turns out securing things is more fun than hacking!

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an healtcare startup, a fintech startup, and a reputed university,. My main focus these days is securing thing that uis accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Chorus!

Here are a few areas I’ve been working with recently:

** Cloud Security , Network security, Web Security, Risk Assesment, Secure coding, DevSecOps **
